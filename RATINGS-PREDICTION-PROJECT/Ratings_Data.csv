I have upgraded from iPhone 7 to iPhone 11.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price.",5

105,"It is better to buy iPhone 11 over iPhone 12 if you prioritize the camera,Its because the difference isn‚Äôt significantly huge except lowlight performance and Go for 128 GB variant rather than 64 GB because the system data alone contains 20 GB of data .
Even though it's 720p LCD display but it's better than todays Android's 1080p display. My phone was a 64GB mint green model and this one is really pretty especially in the real life. I can still get almost everything out of what i paid for at a...

Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",3

1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.

2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...

Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

Suggestion if your phone never gets on.
1. Do not charge your phone
2. Do not try to turn on your phone for next 2 days.
3. After 2-3 days try to turn it on, you'll get the battery icon and at that time keep your phone for charging.

Camera quality is fine, it has automatic filter in the front camera which I don't like. It gets hot fast while playing games so it is good that I'm not a games lover, however, my kids play games on it and I keeps worrying of them... I have given 4 stars because battery backup and fast charging was the priority.",4

This is the best purchase I've made on Flipkart. This phone is quite impressive not only in looks but in performance too.
At this price range:
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Camera needs some optimisation as there is a slightly more yellowish tone than any other colour.
‚Ä¢Fingerprint sensor is not the fastest but decent.
‚Ä¢ Display is just üòò fluid...

I've de given 4 stars because I'm not very impressed with camera and most of all MIUI 12 on Android 10,which slows down...

5841,Recently I bought this router on oct 3rd . The product was good enough and well opted for 2BHK network coverage.,5
5842,Awesome router easy to set up and works perfect,5
5843,740n router is very user friendly and software compatible also. This is the best router from tplink in such a low price. I havebeen using 3 of this routers till today. So go for it as requirment.,5
5844,Awesome Router.. Working well even after 1year. Good Range. Nice Router,5
5845,recommend seller . best quality . best material. thank you . best quality in lower cost. thnk you,4
5846,"The product is very handy and easy to set. I use Alliance Broadband cable net and it was easy to setup the connection to all my devices (mobile, laptops). It supports bands 802.11 n/g/b. In box was a adapter, a 1 m ethernet cable. Better than D-link at this budget range.",4
5847,"This one is actually good..I was using the WR740N 150N router before and I bought this expecting much improvement in coverage..I cannot say there is no improvement at all, but the 740N one would have been sufficient it seems..Setting it up was quite easy..The device works seemlessly and I am quite happy with the purchase..
Pros :
1.Setup is easy
2.Good coverage(for first time buyer)
3.Stable connection
4.No heating or reboot issues
5.Separate on/off button for wifi(which is missing in 740N)

5849,Very nice product . Totally value for money . Easy installation. High range capacity . It doesn't gets off even for a second . I am writing review after 3 months . Never buy dlink or netgear . Better than this is Tenda . Better in every espect and even price is less,5
5850,"Product is satisfactory.
Just a suggestion, if you can have all the user registered online and store their password for router, recovery of password will be good and easy rather than resetting the modem.",5
5851,Better to go for other brands or for the same brand choose another. The signal is not strong enough even if I am 10 ft far away from the router,5
5852,"Awesome product, thanks to flipkart delivery was on time product was unharmed.. The Wi-Fi is good and has a good range. I will recommend this to those who are looking for a WiFi which is cheap and good. It also has its app on playstore which makes it ideal to buy.",5
5853,"After six months of usage the range of the router has reduced to 50 cms. Checked with tp link customer care. Tried several updates of router softwares, factory resets and configuration changes as told by support centre but no improvement in signal strength and signal range.
Conclusion its a bad choice even in case of a small 1bhk with very few wall divisions. Hence not that reliable in the long run.",5

If you have Wall, you will be getting only 2 or 3 signals. if you are happy with that, you can go for that. Except the range issue, this is the best N300 series router to start with. Don't think about NetGear, it is really a piece of Junk, Netgear has to learn a lot from TP-Link.",5

Just one problem that the indicator lights are very dim otherwise it gives other router companies run for their money. It is fairly easy to set up. After not using it for a long time I do not have to restart it on again so that it becomes responsive which I had to do with my previous routers. At the end I would say that its worth buying this router.,5

Pros :

6542,"It took me just 2 minutes to setup this router (I use Tikona). It does what its supposed to do fairly well. Signal strength is pretty good for a 800 sqft house. I only use it for sharing internet to about 5 devices (laptops + smartphones). Occasionally I share files over WiFi - but it is not great.

At this price, I can't ask for more

6553,"The signals of the router doesn't reach even to adjacent room, just two of 'em. Very weak signal strength so gets disconnected every now & then. Therefore, I use my laptop/phone in the same room for connectivity. I don't know if for Rs.1020 one can get any better router than this. But one thing is for sure, it's kind of ""KAAM CHALAU"" type product, neither the best nor better!!! May be an average one(at this price)

not that good range.. but good for home usage!
Do not buy if you need a router with a very long range...",5
6570,Its a decent router with an average range. It has a good outdoor range as compared to indoor. My Installation CD did not work. but I figured out that is because the default IP of the router is 192.168.0.1 but the CD software expects it to be 192.168.1.1 . So I had to manually configure the router. Not suitable for those who dont know the general know how of routers and configuration.,5
